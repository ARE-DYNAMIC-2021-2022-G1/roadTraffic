# Introduction
  Our research work focuses on the modeling of road traffic, and in especially on the carbon footprint of the vehicles using them. Our objective is to create and  to vary different parameters such as the shape of cities, the number of roads, the number of red lights and intersections, the speed of vehicles, the types of transport used: thermal cars, electric cars, buses, trucks and also as well as so-called soft mobility such as bicycles, scooters or walking. Thus, our objective is to find a combination between these different parameters to ultimately reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The challenges of this problem are mainly environmental and therefore it is a topical issue.
