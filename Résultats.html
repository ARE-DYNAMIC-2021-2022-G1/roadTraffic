           We notice first of all, according to the graphic representation and the histogram below, that the most traveled roads
            are the axis (8-9) and (9-10).

           <br>
           <bleu>Indeed these are the main axes within our city and this is true in real life.</bleu>
            <br><br><rouge>Let’s now apply our different experiments:</rouge><br>
           <vert>Experiment 1 - We take the original city, we remove the busiest road(s) and we get 10 new cities,
             we then look at the city model with the least C02 emissions.</vert>
            <br><br>
          By running our road model on each of the new cities and comparing the rate of C02 emitted by each of the cities, we
            get the graph below. It is normal that cities 1,4,5 and 6 have the same C02 emission because it is actually the same city.
            Indeed for this first example we have chosen a very minimalist city model with only about ten roads (see next model
             with the simplified example of the city of Paris.<br>
           <img src="https://i.goopics.net/rxnfh8.png" width="500" height="280"><br>
          
           <bleu>We can see after this first simulation that the original city comes back almost all the time as the one with the least emissions
             of C02 so it is not worth removing roads in a city for ecological measures.</bleu><br><br>
           
            <vert>Experiment 2 - We modify the probability of taking the shortest path.</vert>
           <br><br>
            We create a list of populations in which we modify the percentage to choose the shortest path. It varies between 0.1 and 1 with
             a step of 0.1 to each list. Then, we look at the C02 emissions for each population: here is the graph obtained. Population 1 being
             the one with the least chance of getting the shortest path and population 10 is the one where we always take the shortest path.
             Precision in this minimalist model, the last three populations of (7 to 10) are the same. The result below is therefore consistent.<br>
            <img src="https://i.goopics.net/7r2vgr.png" width="500" height="280"><br>
            <bleu>It is concluded that to obtain the lowest possible carbon emission, in the vast majority of cases cars must
               take the shortest route.</bleu>
            
           
           
           
           <br><br><br>
           
           
          <p><rouge>- Now consider our 'ville_2' (Paris simplified)</rouge>, traveled by 36 cars (50% electric, 50% thermal)
           <br>    
            <vert>Let's check the assumptions made earlier with this new more complex model:</vert><br>

           <br>
           We notice first of all, according to the histogram below, that the most borrowed roads are the axis (8-9) and (9-10). In fact it is
            of the main axes within our city and this is true in real life.
           <br>
           <img src="https://i.goopics.net/29pggl.png" width="260" height="180">
           
           <img src="https://i.goopics.net/tyqrc1.png" width="260" height="180">
           <br>
           <bleu>We note in this simplified model of the city of Paris that the most frequented roads are those of the circular axis around
            from Paris.
            This is verified in real life with the parasitic peripheral, the busiest axis.</bleu><br>
           Also, for all the cars to reach their destination, our road system emitted 35kg of C02.
           <br><br>
            <rouge>Let us now apply our experiments to this new road system:</rouge>
           <br>
           <vert>Experiment 1 - We take the city of origin, we change the roads and we look at the city model with the least C02 emissions.</vert>
           <br><br>
           Here are the changes made to our home city for each of the new cities created (10 new cities based on the model
            of the city of origin but with deletions of roads).<br>
           <img src="https://i.goopics.net/20cd4w.png" width="300" height="750"><br>
           By running our road model on each of the new cities and comparing the rate of C02 emitted by each of the cities here is the
            graph that we get.<br>
           <img src="https://i.goopics.net/85cl5f.png" width="500" height="600"><br>
           <bleu>We conclude that the city of origin comes back almost all the time as the one with the least C02 emissions, therefore to reduce the
              C02 emissions there is no need to close roads.</bleu>
           <br><br>                    
             <vert>Experiment 2- We modify the probability of taking the shortest path.</vert>
           <br><br>
            We create a list of populations in which we modify the percentage to choose the shortest path. It varies between 0.1 and 1 with
             a step of 0.1 to each list. Then, we look at the C02 emissions for each population: here is the graph obtained. Population 1 being
             the one with the least chance of getting the shortest path and population 10 is the one where we always take the shortest path.<br>
            <img src="https://i.goopics.net/5rwsrx.png" width="500" height="280"><br>
            <bleu>It is concluded that to obtain the lowest possible carbon emission, in the vast majority of cases cars must
               take the shortest route.<br>We therefore arrive at the same result as with road system number 1.</bleu>
