    <ul>
        <li>Beginning of our project which consists in modeling the road traffic within a city as well as its carbon impact
            on our environment by varying different parameters such as the shape of our road system, different
            means of transport (thermal car, electric car, hybrid car, bus), intersection numbers, red lights. We have it all
            first carried out a brainstorming to clarify the main ideas of our project. <br>
          We have also shared
            our research of the previous weeks and finalize our documentary research work as well as our bibliography
            whose documents will serve as a basis for coding our model (see "Bibliography" section). then, we have
            started thinking about how to model our road system in python. Our research as well as the advice of our
            professors led us to use adjacent matrices to model our road systems. We have done
            also research regarding the use of the NetworkX library in python.</li>

          <h2><vert>Week 2 of March 21, 2022:</vert></h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>This week we coded in python our first city using the NetworkX library. For this we have used
            an adjacent matrix in which each intersection (node) of our system corresponds to a column. Write 1 to
            the intersection between a row and a column if the two corresponding nodes are linked together, 0 otherwise. <br>
          We have next
            programmed a function 'ville_graph' which allows us to represent our adjacent matrix in the form of a graph therefore corresponds to the
            road system studied. This function largely uses different modules from the NetworkX library (addition of 'nodes' and 'edges').
            It will serve as a basis for us to then evolve our system and represent it graphically at each evolution over time.<br>
            Once this function is complete and our adjacent matrix from last week is correctly represented (arrow in the right direction,
            numbering of each 'node'), we have integrated into our code the 'shortest_path' module which makes it possible to determine the shortest path
            between two 'nodes' (the starting position and the arrival position of a motorist).<br>
            Finally, we searched the NetworkX documentation for a way to add a length attribute to all of our
            roads. There is actually a 'len' parameter in the 'add.edge' function. The length of our routes will be randomly defined between a
            minimum and maximum length given in kilometers.

          <h2><vert>Week 3 of March 28, 2022:</vert></h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Today we researched object programming. We will indeed consider each car as an object
        with different information. For this, we define a Class car at the top of our program. Each car will have
        unique information (starting node, arrival node, speed, min speed, max speed, type of car (thermal, hybrid or electric),
        its CO2 emissions per meter travelled. Now we have to find a way to integrate our cars into our road system. Despite several
        attempts it is not easy, we encountered problems. We will carry out research this week in order to arrive at the
        in place of our cars on our graph next week.<br>
        We also researched how to integrate and use the 'time' module to make our road system evolve at a time step
        fixed (10 seconds).</li>

          <h2><vert>Week 4 of April 4, 2022:</vert></h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Our project is progressing well. First, we developed our car class with the different information needed. Next, we checked
          that the 'shortest_path' module of NetworkX takes into account the distance of our routes. We then created a 'give length'
          function which allows us to retrieve the length of a route (length between two nodes therefore) by using a dictionary which
          gathers all the lengths of the roads in our system.<br>
          We have also coded a function 'index_path' which allows us to retrieve the position of our car in real time on the road.<br>
          Finally, we have created a great function 'change_distance' which allows to move a car every 10s. It therefore calculates
          the distance traveled by a car on the road during the time step of 10 seconds depending on the speed of the car and the length
          of the road. It modifies the parameters of the car: percentage of the distance traveled on a road (edge) according to its speed,
          change of node when you reach the end of the road and addition of the distance traveled on the new road. It carries out the change
          of position of the car as long as the latter has not arrived at its destination. For this, it uses the previous functions (mainly
          indice_path and give_length).</li>
