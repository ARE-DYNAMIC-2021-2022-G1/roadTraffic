    <ul>
        <li>Beginning of our project which consists in modeling the road traffic within a city as well as its carbon impact
            on our environment by varying different parameters such as the shape of our road system, different
            means of transport (thermal car, electric car, hybrid car, bus), intersection numbers, red lights. We have it all
            first carried out a brainstorming to clarify the main ideas of our project. <br>
          We have also shared
            our research of the previous weeks and finalize our documentary research work as well as our bibliography
            whose documents will serve as a basis for coding our model (see "Bibliography" section). then, we have
            started thinking about how to model our road system in python. Our research as well as the advice of our
            professors led us to use adjacent matrices to model our road systems. We have done
            also research regarding the use of the NetworkX library in python.</li>

    </ul>
          <h2><vert>Week 2 of March 21, 2022:</vert></h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>This week we coded in python our first city using the NetworkX library. For this we have used
            an adjacent matrix in which each intersection (node) of our system corresponds to a column. Write 1 to
            the intersection between a row and a column if the two corresponding nodes are linked together, 0 otherwise. <br>
          We have next
          programmed a function <bleu>'ville_graph'</bleu> which allows us to represent our adjacent matrix in the form of a graph therefore corresponds to the
            road system studied. This function largely uses different modules from the NetworkX library (addition of 'nodes' and 'edges').
            It will serve as a basis for us to then evolve our system and represent it graphically at each evolution over time.<br>
            Once this function is complete and our adjacent matrix from last week is correctly represented (arrow in the right direction,
            numbering of each 'node'), we have integrated into our code the <bleu>'shortest_path'</bleu> module which makes it possible to determine the shortest path
            between two 'nodes' (the starting position and the arrival position of a motorist).<br>
            Finally, we searched the NetworkX documentation for a way to add a length attribute to all of our
            roads. There is actually a 'len' parameter in the 'add.edge' function. The length of our routes will be randomly defined between a
            minimum and maximum length given in kilometers.

          <h2><vert>Week 3 of March 28, 2022:</vert></h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Today we researched object programming. We will indeed consider each car as an object
          with different information. For this, we define a <bleu>class car</bleu> at the top of our program. Each car will have
        unique information (starting node, arrival node, speed, min speed, max speed, type of car (thermal, hybrid or electric),
        its CO2 emissions per meter travelled. Now we have to find a way to integrate our cars into our road system. Despite several
        attempts it is not easy, we encountered problems. We will carry out research this week in order to arrive at the
        in place of our cars on our graph next week.<br>
        We also researched how to integrate and use the 'time' module to make our road system evolve at a time step
        fixed (10 seconds).</li>

    </ul>
    
          <h2><vert>Week 4 of April 4, 2022:</vert></h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Our project is progressing well. First, we developed our car class with the different information needed. Next, we checked
          that the <bleu>'shortest_path'</bleu> module of NetworkX takes into account the distance of our routes. We then created a <bleu>'give length'</bleu>
          function which allows us to retrieve the length of a route (length between two nodes therefore) by using a dictionary which
          gathers all the lengths of the roads in our system.<br>
          We have also coded a function <bleu>'index_path'</bleu> which allows us to retrieve the position of our car in real time on the road.<br>
          Also, we have created a great function <bleu>'change_distance'</bleu> which allows to move a car every 10s. It therefore calculates
          the distance traveled by a car on the road during the time step of 10 seconds depending on the speed of the car and the length
          of the road. It modifies the parameters of the car: percentage of the distance traveled on a road (edge) according to its speed,
          change of node when you reach the end of the road and addition of the distance traveled on the new road. It carries out the change
          of position of the car as long as the latter has not arrived at its destination. For this, it uses the previous functions (mainly
          <bleu>'indice_path'</bleu> and <bleu>'give_length'</bleu>).<br>
          Finally, we created the <bleu>'simulation'</bleu> function which is the main function of our project. It includes all the functions we created
          the previous weeks (mainly <bleu>'change_distance'</bleu>). It takes as a parameter the number of cars that travel through our system, the
          population of cars, the size of the city (adjacent matrix size), the graph of the city. It allows cars to evolve and interact with
          our road system. It runs as long as all the cars have not arrived at their destination.</li>
        <br>

    </ul>
        
          <h2><vert>Week 5 of April 11, 2022:</vert></h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Last session for our project. We started by correcting the small problems of the <bleu>'simulation'</bleu> function.<br>
            Once our simulation is running perfectly well, we have coded auxiliary functions. First, <bleu>'nb_voiture_edge_temp_reel'</bleu> which,
          as its name suggests, allows you to know the number of cars moving on each road at each time step. In the logic of this function,
          we have therefore produced the following function: <bleu>'route_plus_sature'</bleu> which returns the list of the most frequented edeges in
          real time (thus corresponding to traffic jams in our road system). We also color the most saturated road(s) on the graphical representation
          of our road system using the <bleu>'color_ville_g'</bleu> function.<br>
          Secondly, we also coded the following functions: <bleu>'route_plus_parcouru_simu'</bleu> which takes the car population as a parameter and which
          concatenates all the paths of the population in the form of tuples and returns the tuple(s) with the most occurrences, as well as the
          <bleu>'number_car_passage_edge'</bleu> function which also takes our initial population of cars as a parameter and which concatenates the paths and
          returns a histogram which represents the number of cars which have passed on each edge at the end of the simulation.<br>
          So we want to see how cars react when a road is closed. For this we delete the most used road from our road system (function <bleu>'suppression_routes'</bleu>)
          and update the new route of each car. Thus, with the same population of cars, we run the model again in the same city but with the busiest road
          or roads closed to traffic and we compare the CO2 levels with different percentages of internal combustion, electric and hybrid cars
          (functions <bleu>'modified_cities'</bleu> and <bleu>'simulation_bis'</bleu>).<br>
          Finally, we want to see what happens when we vary the percentage of taking the shortest path (<bleu>'simulation_2'</bleu> function). Indeed, in real life
          we all take the shortest route when we have to travel (with the fewest kilometers) but it is not always the one that is the fastest
          (in the event of traffic jams in particular) , and the results obtained are represented graphically.<br>
          We finally have our first results (see results section).</li>
